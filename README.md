==================

Formerly the nathanleclaire.com source code.  Migrating over to an Octopress blog soon like a good hacker :)

This app is written in Flask (Python microframework) and is sort of a mutated version of the Flaskr demo app.  It was a good learning experience but I am keen on attaining the nice UI polish and efficiency of static HTML for my personal homepage so that is where I am migrating to.
